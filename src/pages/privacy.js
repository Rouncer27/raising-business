            <h2>Protecting your personal information</h2>
            Your privacy is important to us. It is Raising A Business Podcast
            policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may
            collect while operating our website. Accordingly, we have developed
            this privacy policy in order for you to understand how we collect,
            use, communicate, disclose and otherwise make use of personal
            information. We have outlined our privacy policy below.
            <ul>
              <li>
                We will collect personal information by lawful and fair means
                and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the
                individual concerned.
              </li>
              <li>
                Before or at the time of collecting personal information, we
                will identify the purposes for which information is being
                collected.
              </li>
              <li>
                We will collect and use personal information solely for
                fulfilling those purposes specified by us and for other
                ancillary purposes, unless we obtain the consent of the
                individual concerned or as required by law.
              </li>
              <li>
                Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which it is
                to be used, and, to the extent necessary for those purposes,
                should be accurate, complete, and up-to-date.
              </li>
              <li>
                We will protect personal information by using reasonable
                security safeguards against loss or theft, as well as
                unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.

                We will make readily available to customers information about
                our policies and practices relating to the management of
                personal information.
              </li>
              <li>
                We will only retain personal information for as long as
                necessary for the fulfilment of those purposes.
              </li>
            </ul>
            We are committed to conducting our business in accordance with these
            principles in order to ensure that the confidentiality of personal

              We Monitor Website Traffic and How we use non-personal information
            </h2>
            Like most web servers on the Internet, this website’ servers
            maintain access logs that record web browser activity. These logs
            associate an Internet Protocol (IP) address with each request for
            content from the servers. When you visit this web site, our web
            server automatically collects a limited amount of standard
            information essential to the operation and evaluation of the web
            site. This information includes:
            <ul>
              <li>the page from which you arrived,</li>
              <li>the date and time of your page request,</li>
              <li>
                the IP address your computer is using to receive information,
              </li>
              <li>the type and version of your browser, and</li>
              <li>the name and size of the file you request.</li>
            </ul>
            This information is collected in order to help make our site more
            useful to visitors, to learn about the number of visitors to our
            site, and to learn about the types of technology our visitors use.
            We do not track information about individuals and their visit.
            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            We may use ‘cookies’ that identify you as a return visitor. A cookie
            is a piece of data that a website can send to your browser, which
            may then store the cookie on your hard drive. Cookies do not contain
            any personally identifying information. Browsers allow you to
            disable cookie collection if you wish, or inform you when a cookie
            is being stored on your hard drive.
            <h2>Links to other websites</h2>
            Our website may contain links to enable you to visit other websites
            of interest easily. However, once you have used these links to leave
            our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that
            other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the
            protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst
            visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy
            statement. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy
            statement applicable to the website in question.

            not send ‘spam’ (unsolicited marketing e-mail). If you agree to
            receive e-mail communications from us, every e-mail message we send
            you will include an e-mail address to which you can respond. If at
            any time you decide you do not want to receive marketing e-mail from
            us, simply let us know and we will remove your name and e-mail
            address from our marketing lists. We will do the same with your
